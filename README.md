### Plugin Information

- This plugin allows you to view and control your Govee devices within HomeKit. The plugin:
  - requires your Govee credentials for most device models and Cloud/BLE connections
  - can control certain models locally via LAN control without any Govee credentials
  - does **not** make use of the Govee API key

### Prerequisites

- To use this plugin, you will need to already have:
  - [Node](https://nodejs.org): latest version of `v18` or `v20` - any other major version is not supported.
  - [Homebridge](https://homebridge.io): `v1.6` - refer to link for more information and installation instructions.
  - For bluetooth connectivity, it may be necessary to install extra packages on your system, see [Bluetooth Control](https://github.com/bwp91/homebridge-govee/wiki/Bluetooth-Control). Bluetooth works best when using a Raspberry Pi, not been tested on Windows, and Mac devices are unsupported.
