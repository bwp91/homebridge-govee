### Added

- `H6053` and `H6141` light models to bluetooth-only supported list
- Optionally use a base64 encoded version of your Govee password in the configuration

  - Plugin will apply 'ignore timeout' for incoming API updates if incoming update received over AWS

### Changed

- **Govee Lights**

  - Plugin now uses a fix list of kelvin to RGB calculations (not a formula) which are the values that Govee uses
  - Reduced 'ignore timeout' from 2 minutes to 1 minute as Govee API reaction times seem to have improved

## 3.6.0 (2021-07-20)

### Added

- **Experimental AWS Control**
  - This release includes a new connection method for certain Govee Light models - AWS control - which can improve response times when controlling lights (AWS control is a real-time persistent connection)
  - As with the bluetooth connection, this is still experimental and will only be enabled if explicitly enabled in the plugin settings
  - You can check whether your model supports this connection method in the Homebridge plugin settings UI on the 'My Devices' tab
  - The different connection methods work with each other so it is possible to enable both AWS and bluetooth control for your lights
- **Scenes/Music/DIY Modes**
  - If you Govee Lights support AWS or bluetooth connection, you can use the plugin settings and the Eve app to setup HomeKit scenes for your Govee scenes, music mode and DIY modes that you have created in the Govee app. Check the wiki for more information.
- **New Devices**
  - Support for the H5179 Thermo-Hygrometer via wifi connection

### Changed

- Error stack will be hidden when the disabled plugin message appears in the log
- More colour conversation formula changes

### Fixed

- Brightness fix for the H6003

## 2.9.0 (2021-02-06)

### Added

- This release hopes to bring more reliability when using HomeKit scenes and device groupings, by using:
  - A queueing system for device updates (HTTP requests) to replace the random delays
  - Delays between HTTP requests are set to 7.5 seconds which seems to work reliably
  - The refresh interval for device sync will skip whilst device updates are being sent
- Configuration checks to highlight any unnecessary or incorrectly formatted settings you have
- Link to 'Configuration' wiki page in the plugin-ui

## v2.8.0 (2021-01-18)

### Changed

- Plugin will log incoming device updates in `debug` mode
  - For standard usage I would recommend to have plugin `debug` mode set to OFF/FALSE, as this change will add an update to your log every X seconds depending on your refresh interval (which is 15 seconds by default)

### Fixed

- Brightness fix for `H7022` model

## v2.7.3 (2021-01-14)
