## 3.6.0 (2021-07-20)

### Added

- **Experimental AWS Control**
  - This release includes a new connection method for certain Govee Light models - AWS control - which can improve response times when controlling lights (AWS control is a real-time persistent connection)

  - You can check whether your model supports this connection method in the Homebridge plugin settings UI on the 'My Devices' tab
  - The different connection methods work with each other so it is possible to enable both AWS and bluetooth control for your lights
- **Scenes/Music/DIY Modes**
  - If you Govee Lights support AWS or bluetooth connection, you can use the plugin settings and the Eve app to setup HomeKit scenes for your Govee scenes, music mode and DIY modes that you have created in the Govee app. Check the wiki for more information.

- More colour conversation formula changes

### Fixed
