# Change Log

All notable changes to homebridge-govee will be documented in this file.

This project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/). In practice, this means that the version number will be incremented based on the following:

- `MAJOR` version when a minimum supported version of `homebridge` or `node` is increased to a new major version, or when a breaking change is made to the plugin config
- `MINOR` version when a new device type is added, or when a new feature is added that is backwards-compatible
- `PATCH` version when backwards-compatible bug fixes are implemented

  - You can check whether your model supports this connection method in the Homebridge plugin settings UI on the 'My Devices' tab
  - The different connection methods work with each other so it is possible to enable both AWS and bluetooth control for your lights
- **Scenes/Music/DIY Modes**
  - If you Govee Lights support AWS or bluetooth connection, you can use the plugin settings and the Eve app to setup HomeKit scenes for your Govee scenes, music mode and DIY modes that you have created in the Govee app. Check the wiki for more information.

### Changed

- Error stack will be hidden when the disabled plugin message appears in the log
- More colour conversation formula changes

### Fixed

- Brightness fix for the H6003

## 2.9.0 (2021-02-06)

### Added

- This release hopes to bring more reliability when using HomeKit scenes and device groupings, by using:
  - A queueing system for device updates (HTTP requests) to replace the random delays
  - Delays between HTTP requests are set to 7.5 seconds which seems to work reliably
  - The refresh interval for device sync will skip whilst device updates are being sent
- Configuration checks to highlight any unnecessary or incorrectly formatted settings you have
- Link to 'Configuration' wiki page in the plugin-ui

## v2.8.0 (2021-01-18)

### Changed

- Plugin will log incoming device updates in `debug` mode
  - For standard usage I would recommend to have plugin `debug` mode set to OFF/FALSE, as this change will add an update to your log every X seconds depending on your refresh interval (which is 15 seconds by default)

### Fixed

- Brightness fix for `H7022` model

## v2.7.3 (2021-01-14)
